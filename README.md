# Electronics Online Store

## Introduction:
Welcome to my comprehensive data analysis portfolio, where I delve into the purchase data collected from a large home appliances and electronics online store. The dataset spans from April 2020 to November 2020, providing a rich source of information about the interactions between products and users.

The dataset, obtained through the Open CDP project, captures events related to product transactions. Each row in the file signifies an event, representing a many-to-many relationship between products and users. This unique perspective allows for a thorough exploration of customer behavior, product performance, and valuable business insights.

Throughout this portfolio, I leverage my skills as a data analyst to unravel patterns, trends, and meaningful correlations within this extensive dataset. The data, sourced from an open customer data platform, enables a deep dive into the dynamics of an online store, offering opportunities to extract actionable insights and recommendations.

Feel free to join me on this analytical journey as we unlock the potential hidden within the realms of home appliances and electronics purchase data.
